EXPECTED LEX OUTPUT ANALYSIS:
Line 1: This line attempts to declare the program's name, but with an unconventional capitalization of "ProGram". Given that Pascal is case-insensitive, this should be recognized as a reserved word, and "test" as an ID.

Line: 1, 1st char: 1, “ProGram” is a “reserved word”.
Line: 1, 1st char: 9, “test” is an “ID”.
Line: 1, 1st char: 13, “;” is a “symbol”.
Line 2: Starts the variable declaration section.

Line: 2, 1st char: 1, “var” is a “reserved word”.
Line 3: The variable name #db begins with a symbol, which is not valid in traditional Pascal for identifiers. Assuming your scanner is configured to flag invalid identifiers:

Line: 3, 1st char: 3, “#db” is an “invalid ID”.
Line: 3, 1st char: 7, “:” is a “symbol”.
Line: 3, 1st char: 9, “float” is a “reserved word”.
Line: 3, 1st char: 14, “;” is a “symbol”.
Line 4: The variable _f2 is declared as a float, which is correct.

Line: 4, 1st char: 3, “_f2” is an “ID”.
Line: 4, 1st char: 7, “:” is a “symbol”.
Line: 4, 1st char: 9, “float” is a “reserved word”.
Line: 4, 1st char: 14, “;” is a “symbol”.
Line 5: Marks the beginning of the program's main block.

Line: 5, 1st char: 1, “begin” is a “reserved word”.
Line 6: Attempts to assign a value to #db, which was flagged as an invalid identifier. Assuming your scanner is capable of processing the assignment to an invalid ID:

Line: 6, 1st char: 3, “#db” is an “invalid ID”.
Line: 6, 1st char: 7, “:=” is a “symbol”.
Given the use of .1, which is not traditionally allowed without a leading digit in many Pascal variants: Line: 6, 1st char: 10, “.1” is an “invalid real number”.
Line: 6, 1st char: 12, “;” is a “symbol”.
Line 7: Correctly assigns a floating-point number to _f2.

Line: 7, 1st char: 3, “_f2” is an “ID”.
Line: 7, 1st char: 7, “:=” is a “symbol”.
Though 12.100 may be considered more detailed than necessary due to trailing zeros, it's a valid floating-point number: Line: 7, 1st char: 10, “12.100” is a “real number”.
Line: 7, 1st char: 16, “;” is a “symbol”.
Line 8: Marks the end of the program's main block.

Line: 8, 1st char: 1, “end” is a “reserved word”.
Line: 8, 1st char: 4, “;” is a “symbol”.
